In this model multiple development cycle can take place and each cycle divided <a href="javascript:openDSC(27336962, 1, '25227');" onmouseover="doRollover(49);" onmouseout="undoRollover(49);" id="25227" name="49" style="color:#009cff" class="#009cff"><span class="b-ref">49</span>into smaller, more easily managed<span> iteration. </span>Each iteration passes through the requirements, design, implementation and testing phases.<span> The </span>process</a> continues till the complete system is achieved. 1.6.2 Reason for selecting the Incremental model: ? Major requirements of system are defined. ? Some requirements may evolve with time. ? Using new technology for development. ? Each iteration will be easily managed. ? Development and testing task easy to manage in small iterations. ? Risk of Requirement changing is reduced. 1.7 Project Tracking 1.7.1 Issue Tracking For Issue tracking we will use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word. We also use any freeware Issue tacking web based tool 1.7.2 Weekly Status Reporting We will use defined standard status report for weekly status reporting. That report will depict overall project status along with individual status. 1.8 Team Contact Details Name Role Location Email Waqas Zyad Project Supervisor FAST University waqas.zyad@nu.edu.pk Mahhek Tahir Project Lead /Developer FAST University L125422@nu.edu.pk Khizra Samad QA Analyst /Tester FAST University L125419@nu.edu.pk Asma Shaheen Business Analyst/Tester FAST University L125410@nu.edu.pk Bilal Farooq Ahmad Developer FAST University L125406@nu.edu.pk 1.9 Development Environment Following are the minimum software and hardware requirement for Alumni &amp; Faculty Portal. 1.9.1 Hardware Requirements Server Side Machine <a href="javascript:openDSC(3465872495, 943, '13814');" onmouseover="doRollover(83);" onmouseout="undoRollover(83);" id="13814" name="83" style="color:#33cc99" class="#33cc99"><span class="b-ref">83</span>Core I 3 RAM 2 GB Hard Disk<span> 80 </span>GB</a> Client Side Machine PIII 500 MHz RAM 1GB Hard Disk 20 GB 1.9.2 Software Requirements Development Dreamweaver, Apache server, MySQL, ROR ,Windows XP Project Schedule Microsoft Project Configuration Management GitHub Task Management <a href="javascript:openDSC(39845953, 37, '25384');" onmouseover="doRollover(96);" onmouseout="undoRollover(96);" id="25384" name="96" style="color:#006331" class="#006331"><span class="b-ref">96</span>Microsoft Word / Microsoft Excel<span> Issue Tracking </span>Microsoft<span> Word / </span>Microsoft<span> Excel Documentation </span>Microsoft</a> Word / Microsoft Excel Design Rational Rose / Visio SECTION 2 - REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION 2.1 Introduction The requirement specification specifies the software requirements for FAST Alumni and Faculty Portal.

Understanding and Observing other existing dashboards systems The intended audiences for this document are the domain holders and the system developers. 2.3 Overview In FAST currently there is no active system which stores Alumni and Faculty information. Whenever University or Faculty members need to approach any alumni or other faculty members they have to face a lot of difficulties and sometime it takes many days to get the contact details of alumni member or any other faculty member. Lack of a proper platform to integrate all facilities regarding job offerings, scholarship postings and project listing has been always a major issue for FAST administration. There was a need felt for a system with features which can allow the administration and faculty member to access contact details of alumni and other faculty members. It will allow the users to design their own web page. On this webpage these members will be able to add their details regarding academic, professional and ongoing projects. It should also provide a stage for job postings, scholarships and mini-projects listings and a forum where they can create discussion topics and post comment on topics. It will be highly valuable and useful system for students because it will provide a professional, comprehensive career and employment related service to students and alumni with no charges. Business Process: Admin Alumni Alumni &amp; Faulty Portal Business Process: Faculty Business Process: Student 2.3.1 Product Perspective FAST Alumni and Faculty Portal will be a web based application.

Mitigation The cost associated with a computer crash resulting in a loss of data is crucial. A computer crash itself is not crucial, but rather the loss of data. A loss of data will result in not being able to deliver the product to the customer. This will result in a not receiving a letter of acceptance from the customer. Without the letter of acceptance, the group will receive a failing grade for the course. As a result the<span> team </span>is taking steps to make multiple backup copies of the software in development and all documentation associated with it, in multiple locations. ? Monitoring When working on the product or documentation, the<span> team </span>member should always be aware of the stability of the computing environment they’re working in. Any changes in the stability of the environment should be recognized and taken seriously. ? Management The lack of a stable-computing environment is extremely hazardous to a software development team. In the event that the computing environment is found unstable, the development team should cease work on that system until the environment is made stable again, or should move to a system that is stable and continue working there<span> 6.13.1 </span>Risk: Late Delivery ? Mitigation The cost associated with a late delivery is critical. A late delivery will result in a late delivery of a letter of acceptance from the customer. Without the letter of acceptance, the group will receive a failing grade for the course. Steps have been taken to ensure a timely delivery by gauging the scope of project based on the delivery deadline. ? Monitoring A schedule has been established to monitor project status. Falling behind schedule would indicate a potential for late delivery. The schedule will be followed closely during all development stages. ? Management Late delivery would be a<span> critical </span>failure in the project development. If the project cannot be delivered on time the<span> project </span>team will not pass the course. If it becomes apparent that the project will not be completed on time, the only course of action available would be to request an extension to the deadline form the</a> supervisor. 6.13.2 <a href="javascript:openDSC(2423511363, 43, '116');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="116" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>Risk: Technology Does Not Meet Specifications ? Mitigation In order to prevent this from happening, meetings (formal and informal) will be held with the customer on a routine business. This insures that the product we are producing and the specifications of the customer are equivalent. ? Monitoring The meetings with the customer should ensure that the customer and our<span> team </span>understand each other and the requirements for the product. ? Management Should the<span> project </span>team come to the realization that their idea of the product specifications differs from those of the customer, the customer should be immediately notified and whatever steps necessary to rectify this problem should be done. Preferably a meeting should be held between the development team and the<span> supervisor </span>to discuss at length this issue.<span> 6.13.3 </span>Risk: End Users Resist System ? Mitigation In order to prevent this from happening, the software will be developed with the end user in mind. The user-interface will be designed in a way to make use of the program convenient and pleasurable. ? Monitoring The software will be developed with the end user in mind. The development team will ask the opinion of various outside sources</a> and other faculty members <a href="javascript:openDSC(2423511363, 43, '141');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="141" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>throughout the development phases. Specifically the user-interface developer will be sure to get a thorough opinion from others. ? Management Should the program be resisted by the end user, the program will be thoroughly examined to find the reasons that this is so. Specifically the user interface will be investigated and if necessary, revamped into a solution.<span> 6.13.4 </span>Risk: Changes in Requirements ? Mitigation In order to prevent this from happening, meetings (formal and informal) will be held with the customer on a routine business. This insures that the product we are producing and the requirements of the customer are equivalent. ? Monitoring The meetings with the customer should ensure that the customer and our<span> team </span>understand each other and the requirements for the product. ? Management Should the development team come to the realization that their idea of the product requirements differs from those of the customer, the customer should be immediately notified and whatever steps necessary to rectify this problem should be taken. Preferably a meeting should be held between the development team and the<span> supervisor </span>to discuss at length this issue.<span> 6.13.5 </span>Risk: Lack of Development Experience ? Mitigation In order to prevent this from happening, the development team will be required to learn the languages and techniques necessary to develop this software. The member of the team that is the most experienced in a particular facet of the development tools will need to instruct those who are not as well versed. ? Monitoring Each member of the team should watch and see areas where another team member may be weak. Also if one of the members is weak in a particular area it should be brought to the attention by that member, to the other members. ? Management The members who have the most experience in a particular area will be required to help those who don’t out should it come to the attention of the team that a particular member needs help.<span> 6.13.6 </span>Risk: Database is not Stable ? Mitigation In order to prevent this from happening, developers who are in contact with the database, and/or use functions that interact with the database, should keep in mind the possible errors that could be caused due to poor programming/error checking. These issues should be brought to the attention of each of the other members that are also in contact with the database. ? Monitoring Each user should be sure that the database is left in the condition it was before it was touched, to identify possible problems. The first notice of database errors should be brought to the attention of the other team members. ? Management Should this occur, the organization would call a meeting and discuss the causes of the database instability, along with possible solutions.<span> 6.13.7 </span>Risk:</a><a href="javascript:openDSC(2423511363, 43, '184');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="184" name="1" style="color:red" class="red"><span class="b-ref">1</span>Deviation from Software Engineering Standards ? Mitigation While it is possible to deviate from software engineering standards, it is unlikely to occur. All team members have a full understanding of the software process, and how we plan to implement them in the process. ? Monitoring Technical reviews involving comparison between documentation and the actual project will help to determine if deviation will occur. All relevant documents must be as complete and accurate as possible to ensure that work will conform to expressed software engineering standards. ? Management Should deviation occur, steps must be taken to guide the project back within the standards expressed in accompanying documents. Technical reviews help to determine what must be done to keep the project in line with established software engineering standards<span> 6.13.8 </span>Risk: Poor Comments in Code ? Mitigation Poor code commenting can be minimized if commenting standards are better expressed. While standards have been discussed informally, no formal standard yet exists. A formal written standard must be established to ensure quality of comments in all code. ? Monitoring Reviews of code, with special attention given to comments will determine if they are up to standard. This must be done frequently enough to control comment quality. If they are not done comment quality could drop, resulting in code that is difficult to maintain and update. ? Management Should code comment quality begin to drop, time must be made available to bring comments up to standard. Careful monitoring will minimize the impact of poor commenting. Any problems are resolved by adding and refining comments as necessary.</a> 6.14 Guidelines The Following tasks need to be performed for Risk Response Planning section of the Risk Management Workbook: 1. Team will monitor risk status on weekly basis or as required. 2. The status of the risk will be communicated to the affected groups as well as individuals. 3. Mitigation action status will be monitored and updated on weekly basis or as appropriate. 4. A planned start and end period will be documented for mitigation plan and contingency plan. 5. Contingency action status will be updated as appropriate. 6. In Risk analysis report Lesson Learnt the experience and remarks will be addressed.

Almost everything should take more than one commit. ? Use plugins only if they’re exactly what you need. Do not cargo cult. ? In Ruby Regexes \A is the beginning of the string and \z is the end, ^ and $ also match the beginning and end of lines. You almost always want \A and \z, especially in input validations. ? Try to keep initializers limited to config. ? Make sure your calls to the database are including everything they need to in the original call, N+1 problems are way too common in most rails apps.<span> ?

SECTION 9 - CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN 9.1 Introduction The Configuration Management Plan identifies the items to be managed, the methods by which they are managed , the control processes necessary for coordination and control and Configuration Management Organization for Fast Alumni and Faculty Portal. 9.2 Purpose The purpose of this document is to describe the policies, methods and Configuration activities used during the life cycle of Fast Alumni and Faculty Portal. The document also provides details that how the configuration items will be managed and controlled during different stages. 9.3 Scope The Configuration Management Plan describes the Configuration Management functions and their relationships to the activities necessary to control the configurations. This Configuration Management Plan also states the methodology for implementing following ? Configuration Identification ? Configuration Control ? Configuration Status Accounting ? Configuration Audit This Configuration Management Plan applies to all software and documentation, developed and maintained at Fast Alumni and Faculty Portal. However it will be updated as additional configuration activities are defined as the work proceeds and the necessity arises on later stages. 9.3.1 Configuration Identification The Configuration Identification defines the functional and physical characteristics of a Configuration item in detail so that it may be developed, tested, evaluated, accepted, operated, maintained, and supported. 9.3.2 Configuration Control The process of evaluating, approving or disapproving, and managing changes to controlled items. This includes tracking the configuration of each of the Configuration item, approving a new configuration if necessary, and updating the baseline. 9.3.3 Configuration Status Accounting Configuration Status Accounting is a process of recording and reporting of information and date related to configuration management. The recording and reporting of information is helpful to manage a configuration effectively. This information includes a listing of the approved configuration identification, the status of proposed changes to the configuration, and the implementation status of approved changes. 9.3.4 Configuration Audit The purpose of Configuration Audit is to verify Configuration item, or a collection of Configuration items conforms to a specified standard or requirement. This includes functional and physical configuration audits 9.4 Configuration Management Organization This Configuration Management Organization identifies the roles of individuals and groups that participate in the SCM process. It also describes the relationships between individuals and groups. 9.5 Roles &amp; Responsibilities 9.5.1 Project Team Lead ? ? Identifies all application software configuration items to the Configuration Manager. Establish the overall project schedule for Configuration Management (CM) activities with Configuration Manager (CM) ? Make sure team members are knowledgeable of CM concepts and techniques and that they are applied to project activities ? Ensure compliance with the CM standards and procedures set by the CM, the Configuration Control Board (CCB), and any other affected groups as outlined in this plan 9.5.2 Configuration Manager The Configuration Manager (CM) prepare CM plan with the help of project Team Lead. The CM is responsible for creating and updating the CM Plan, as well as communicating the contents of the plan to the project team. In Fast Alumni and Faculty Portal Business Analyst will act as CM. Following are the responsibilities of CM: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Identify the Configuration Items (CIs). Provides strategic direction to CM activities. Create, manage, update and maintain the CM Plan, standards, and procedures. Communicate any changes to the CM Plan, standards, and procedures to all stakeholders Approve changes to the CM Plan. Participate as a member of the Configuration Control Board (CCB). Make sure that configuration item change requests and problem reports for all CIs are initiated, recorded, reviewed, approved, and tracked according to the SCM Plan. ? ? Ensure all Functional and Physical Configuration Audits are performed. Respond to requests for status regarding CM activities. 9.5.3 QA Analyst The QA Analyst is responsible for maintaining all Change Requests of Fast Alumni and Faculty Portal. Following are the responsibilities of QA Analyst: ? Process and track software change requests ? Maintains and controls access to the change tracking system ? Supports all activities relating to CM tools ? Maintains requirements tool ? Maintain and support testing tools ? Reviews key documents ? Supports CM activities, such as CCB meetings and CM audits 9.6 Configuration Control Board The Configuration Control Board (CCB) comprise of technical and administrative representatives who review and authorize changes to an approved baseline. (CCB) will be established after the initial requirements baseline is established. The CCB meeting will be conducted on need bases or depending on the number of new Change Requests. Each Configuration Control Board meeting will have an agenda and minutes. The general agenda will include status reports from development efforts, change requests, and problem reports received from operations (i.e., centers exchanging data). Minutes will be kept which identify decisions and approvals made during each Configuration Control Board meeting as well as requests for future agenda items. The Configuration Control Board will review problem reports and requests for changes. The CCB will determine the changes needed and a general timeline for development and deployment, which initially will be based upon recommendations and estimates supplied by project team. 9.7 Configuration Items For Fast Alumni and Faculty Portal following Configuration Items have been identified: ? Software Development Plan ? Project Plan ? Software Requirement Specifications ? Software Quality Assurance Plan ? Risk Management Plan ? Risk Analysis Report ? Test Plan ? Code ? Design Document ? Test case document ? Request for Change ? Software Functional Specifications ? Weekly Status Report 9.8 Configuration Management Policies 9.8.1 System-Level Requirements Specifications Configuration Identification Policies ? ? One and only one system-level specification must exist for the system. The approved system-level requirements specification will be base-lined (as the Functional Baseline) and will be subject to formal change control. ? The content of the system-level requirements specification must be unambiguous, consistent, complete and testable. ? The system-level requirements specification establishes the acceptance criteria for the system. 9.8.2 Software Configuration Identification Policies ? ? ? Each application software configuration item must have a specification document. Application software specifications should be contained in separate documents. Each application software specification will be base-lined (as part of the Allocated Baseline) and subject to formal change control. ? Application software specifications should be traceable to the system-level requirements specification. ? The content of the application software specification establishes the acceptance criteria for that software configuration item. ? Each application software specification will be numbered with the configuration items identifier as part of the document number, for example, the specification for application software configuration item S480 will be S480-SPEC. 9.8.3 Hardware Configuration Identification Policies ? ? Each hardware and system software configuration item must have a specification document. All hardware and system software specifications may be packaged into a single document provided the requirements for each CI are separately and easily identifiable (the recommendation of the Configuration Manager is that separate documents be used). ? Each hardware and system software specification will be base-lined (as part of the Allocated Baseline) and subject to formal change control. ? Hardware and system software specifications must be traceable to the system-level requirements specification. ? The content of the hardware and system software specification establishes the acceptance criteria for that product. ? Each hardware and system software specification will be numbered with the configuration item's identifier as part of the document number, for example, the specification for hardware configuration item H820 will be H820-SPEC. ? Hardware items will not be marked, however a log will be maintained by Configuration Management personnel that links the manufacturer's name, and model number to the hardware or system software configuration item. 9.8.4 Media Configuration Identification Policies ? Media containing the electronic version of an application software CI will be labeled with its contents; for example, the tape (or floppy disk) containing the source or executable code for CI S910 will be labeled as S910-DM (for Distribution Media). ? If a single tape or floppy disk will contain all application software CIs, it shall be numbered S890- DM. ? ? Media labels must contain the date of creation. Media labels must contain instructions for loading the software (or instructions to read the attached installation instructions document). ? Media labels must contain instructions for disposing of the media (return to originator, use as scratch media, destroy, etc.) 9.8.5 Documentation Change Control Policy After the initial acceptance of a document, further changes will be subject to formal change control. ? If only certain pages (less than 30% of the document) are changed, then change pages shall be issued; the document number will not change. ? If the document is reissued in its entirety (more than 30% of the pages are changed), the document number will have the revision identifier appended; for example, document &lt;doc.nr.&gt; will become document &lt;doc.nr.&gt;. ? In all cases, change bars shall be used to indicate changed material. ? The date of issue will be recorded on the footer of each page. ? All changes made to previously approved documents must also be approved before release (via a Change Request). 9.9 Change Control Procedures The configuration control process provides for an orderly incorporation and documentation of approved changes to the formal configuration baseline. Changes can originate as enhancements to existing functionality, hardware problem reports, software problem reports, or notifications of necessary hardware or software upgrades and/or patches that may impact the Interim system. There are three types of change requests that may be submitted. The three types of reports are defined below: ? Software Change Request (SCR) This will document the nature and functional requirements addressed by a proposed change to the software or Interface Control Documents. Requests may be made by participating Centers. The process utilized to review, deny, or approve the change is outlined by the form structure and the basic procedure outlined below. ? Problem Report (PR) Problem reports will be the basic mechanism for centers to report data or functionality problems. ? Maintenance Change Request (MCR) Regular and periodic upgrades to COTS products needed to keep the system operational. 9.10 Change Request Process A Change Request Form will be submitted to CCB for approval. The CCB may designate a person to coordinate information prior to a CCB meeting. CCB meetings can be scheduled or held at periodic intervals or need basis. The process for submitting a change request follows: ? Submitter completes Change Request (CR) Form and posts it to the appropriate area of the collaboration tool. Optimally, the collaboration tool will notify CCB members via email when changes are submitted. ? Prior to a CCB meeting, a member of the CCB or designate will collect Change Request forms. ? The designate will coordinate with submitters to ensure any further information is acquired prior to the CCB meeting. ? ? ? The designate will distribute information to CCB members prior to meeting. A CCB meeting is scheduled. The CCB meets in person or via phone conference and determines the disposition of open (i.e., reports not yet addressed) CR(s), PR(s) and MCR(s). ? The CCB designate documents CCB major decisions in meeting minutes and the final disposition of CR(s), PR(s) and MCR(s) ensures the disposition and other relevant comments are reposed with the report in the selected repository. ? A CCB designate, if necessary, notifies change request submitters of the final disposition. Before a change to a CI is implemented in the Production version of the system, the CCB will review all test results from acceptance testing to ensure all functional requirements are met and have been adequately tested. The review will make sure that adequate evaluation of the effect of the change is performed in advance and a recovery strategy to restore the system to pre-change condition is clearly identified. The test results shall be provided to the CCB minimally one week prior to the CCB meeting. Additionally, the CCB may request a QA to ensure that the new release contains all of the agreed upon changes and documentation updates. 9.11 Tools and Technologies 9.11.1 Configuration Status Accounting Tool The Word tables will be used to maintain Configuration Accounting System manually. The Configuration Manager will be responsible to maintain the document containing the Configuration Status Accounting information. Configuration Status Accounting has the following objectives in this Configuration Management Plan: ? Maintain records of the configuration status of all entities that have been placed under configuration control at the project level or higher. ? ? Maintain records for the life of the project Produce reports that include the current version, revision, or release status of each CI, a record of changes to the CI since it was placed under configuration control, and the status of problem reports and change requests that affect the CI 9.11.2 Software Version Control Tool GitHub will be used as version control tool. Some key benefits of GitHub are listed below. ? It allows Only one .git directory per repository ? It provides facility to commit any time whenever required, even when you're not connected to the network. ? Lower risk of project Data redundancy, replication and loss because of server failure. ? One can work in his repo even server is down and no network available. ? It provides more flexible workflows that help you work better, smarter, and with less overall stress. ? Git's repo file formats are simple, so repair is easy and corruption is rare. ? All developed application and test software source code is managed with Git. ? It helps in tracking change. 9.12 Configuration Audits The Configuration Management Plan ensures successful completion of audit and is used as a prerequisite for the establishment of the product baseline in the initial Configuration Management process. It is used throughout the project for the review of Configuration Management processes. The audit determines whether the CI satisfies the functions defined in the specifications. The Configuration Manager (CM) is responsible for ensuring that a configuration audit is performed and results of the completed audit are used by the Configuration Control Board (CCB) to authorize a new baseline. 9.13 Change Request Form CHANGE REQUEST FORM Project Name Request No Project Sponsor Date of Request Request Title Requested By Change Request Detail Change Request Type ?
